# Houser_Grid_Layout_Problem
You have a house with a grid layout for its rooms. Each room is of the same size and uniquely numbered. The house has two gates GATE1 and GATE2 â€“ each gate works as an entry and exit point. A person enters through gate GATE1, walks through each room and then leave through GATE2. Similarly, a person may enter through gate GATE2, walk through each room and then leave through GATE1.  Write a program that given two persons P1 and P2 entering from gates GATE1 and GATE2 respectively, find the room in the house that they meet? person P1 spends time T1 in each room before moving to the next room sequentially i.e. from 1 to 2 to 3 and so on and person P2 spends time T2 in each room before moving to the next room sequentially. 

Program Input
Your program should take the below as input from the user 1. Number of rooms in the house 2. Time spent by person P1 in each room 3. Time spent by person P2 in each room Assume P1 always starts at room 1 and P2 at the last room. 

Output
1. Program with adequate comments 2. Correctness of program to compute result 3. Program should print the room number where the two persons meet
